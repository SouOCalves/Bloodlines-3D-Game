## GROUP E - BLOODLINES

![Bloodlines trailer and demonstration](./docs/bloodlinesgif.gif)

For this unit's project, we designed and developed a 3D soulslike game with Unity. All aspects including asset creation, sound design and development were made by our team.

## Premise

A knight, whose family castle was taken from them, sets on a quest to reconquer the huge castle filled with enemies. However, this is not an easy task, so if the knight fails, their descendants will take the mission upon themselves.
